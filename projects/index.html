      <h2>Oreblood Peak</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Oreblood Peak is a roguelite dungeon crawler game where you play as a dwarf decending into the caverns below Oreblood Peak in search of the elusive Oreblood, a magical material that can be used to forge new upgrades to your character.</p>
        <p>I made it from scratch in C++ without an engine using the SDL2 library. I decided to use SDL2 instead of WinAPI (what I used for Snake.exe) because SDL2 can be compiled to most platforms, whereas WinAPI can only be compiled to Windows. It is a work in progress passion project that I hope to complete by early 2026.</p>

      <h2>Snake.exe</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p>One day I decided I wanted to try to make a game from scratch in C++ without any game engine. I wanted to start with something simple as a proof of concept. I decided to recreate the classic Snake game using WinAPI, which is a C++ library that allows you to interface with the Windows operating system and compile to a Windows .exe file.</p>

      <h2>Cole's Cellular Automaton</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p> <a href="https://colepropach.com/cca" target="_blank"><img src="https://cole-propach.github.io/website/images/snowflake.gif" alt="Showcase of the snowflake pattern I found in my cellular automaton" /><br>Click here to try out my cellular automaton!</a> <br>
          I was inspired by Conway's Game of Life and wanted to make my own cellular automaton with my own set of rules. For information about what a cellular automaton is, check out the wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>
          Like Conway's Game of Life, my cells can be in one of 2 states: alive, or dead. <br>A cell's neighborhood is composed of 4 leaves (labeled with 1, 2, 3, and 4). 0s are ignored cells, and C is the cell whose neighborhood we are looking at.<br><br>
        </p>
          
        <pre>
        0 0 1 0 0
        0 0 1 0 0
        4 4 C 2 2
        0 0 3 0 0
        0 0 3 0 0
        </pre>

        <p>Leaves can be in 1 of 3 states, depending on the number of live cells it contains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unpopulated:</strong> The leaf has exactly 0 live cells</li>
            <li><strong>Semi Populated:</strong> The leaf has exactly 1 live cell</li>
            <li><strong>Fully Populated:</strong> The leaf has exactly 2 live cells</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Rules (inspired by Conway's Game of Life):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Live Cells</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overpopulation:</strong> A live cell with any fully populated leaves dies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Underpopulation:</strong> A live cell with 0 semi populated leaves dies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Survival:</strong> A live cell with any semi populated leaves stays alive.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dead Cells</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> A dead cell with exactly 2 semi populated leaves becomes alive.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I coded the program in C++ with SDL2 and compiled it to web assembly using <a href="https://emscripten.org">emscripten</a> so it could be easily run in the browser. <br>
        After I finished the basic program I played around with it a bunch by making random chaotic shapes and seeing how they would evolve over time. I discovered many interesting properties and configurations. I added the 9 most interesting configurations I found as presets that can be loaded in with the number keys. My favorite find was a stable cycle that has 81 unique states before returning back to the original state.</p>
