      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <div class="box">
        <p>Hi! I'm Cole. Thanks for checking out my page. Let me tell you a bit about myself.</p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2025 with a major in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in Music. Most of my CS courses were taught in C and C++, though countless languages including Python and Javascript were covered. For my music minor I was a member of the Concert Choir as well as the Jazz Ensemble, where I played piano.</p>
        <h3>Passions</h3>
        <p>I've always had a passion for coding ever since I took AP Computer Science in highschool. I've practiced a variety of langauges, with most of my work being done in C++. If you check out my <a href="https://colepropach.com/projects">projects</a> page, you'll see that I am an aspiring game developer and love designing fun games for people to play. I also love performing and composing music, and am currently working on soundtracks for multiple of my games.</p>
